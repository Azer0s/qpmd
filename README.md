# Quacktor Port Mapper Daemon

## Usage 

To get qmpd up and running you first have to install the daemon and then start it.
```
qpmd install
qpmd start
```

If you don't want qpmd as a daemon process and prefer to run it as a normal application instead, you can just run qpmd without any arguments.

```
qpmd
```
